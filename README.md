# Pomodoro Timer

[Demo - Work in Progress](https://codemodeactivate.github.io/pomodoro/)

Ah, the ubiquitous pomodoro timer. A right of passage for new javascripters, evidently.

## User Story

- As a user I would like to have a timer that counts down in the pomodoro method, so that I can help with my time management.
- As a user, I would like to have a visual representation of the tomato that follows the same pattern as a clock, so that I can tell how much longer I have by looking at the angle of the tomato that's missing.

### Nice to have
- As a user, I would like to be able to enter custom work and break periods via an input box.
